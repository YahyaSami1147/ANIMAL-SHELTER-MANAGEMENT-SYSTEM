# ANIMAL-SHELTER-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
The Animal Shelter Management System Database (ADMS) is designed to streamline the operations of animal shelters by providing a robust and efficient system for managing animal records, adoption requests, and employee data. This project aims to enhance workflow efficiency, improve communication with potential adopters, and support shelters in their mission to provide care and find homes for abandoned and stray animals.

Key Features
Comprehensive Animal Records: Centralized table capturing vital details (ID, name, species, age) for easy retrieval.
Specialized Tables for Dogs and Cats: Dedicated tables with relationships to the main Animals table, supporting detailed breed-specific data.
Employee Management: Tracks shelter staff and roles for efficient management.
Adoption Request Tracking: Records potential adopters’ preferences and requests, simplifying the adoption process.
Performance Optimization: Utilizes horizontal partitioning for improved performance and manageability with large datasets.
Database Concepts Implemented
Schema Design: Includes inheritance and foreign keys for logical table relationships.
Normalization: Reduces redundancy for a clean, structured database.
Data Definition Language (DDL): Defines tables and their interrelations.
Data Manipulation Language (DML): Enables efficient data updates and request processing.
Purpose
The ADMS database empowers animal shelters by modernizing their operations, supporting better data management, and ensuring efficient processing of adoption requests. The system helps shelters focus on improving animal welfare and facilitating more successful adoptions.

This project demonstrates the application of fundamental database principles in a real-world context, benefiting both shelters and the communities they serve.
